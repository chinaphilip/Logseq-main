title:: ViBERTgrid: A Jointly Trained Multi-Modal 2D Document Representation for Key Information Extraction from Documents

- According to their used document representation methods, these approaches could be roughly categorized into three types:
	- sequence-based
	- graph-based
	- grid-based
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664416411522_0.png)
- hese words 
  are then organized as a unidimensional sequence of length � , denoted as � =
  (�(&)
  , �())
  , ⋯ , �(+)
  ), by reading them in a top-left to bottom-right order
- As the maximum input sequence length of BERT is restricted to 512, we use a sliding window to slice long sequences (with a length greater than 510) into several fixed-length subsequences whose lengths are set to 510. Neighboring subsequences are not overlapped with each other.
