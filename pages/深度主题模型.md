- We evaluate the topic quality in terms of both topicdiversity and topic coherence:
	- **Topic Diversity**(TU) (Nan et al., 2019) measures the uniqueness of the words across all topics;
	- **Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information**(NPMI) (Newman et al., 2010) measures topic coherence internally using a sliding window to count word co-occurrence patterns;
	  **Topic Coherence**(CV ) (Röder et al., 2015) is a variant of NPMI that uses the one-set segmentation to count word co-occurrences and the cosine similarity as the similarity measure.
