title:: HIBRIDS: Attention with Hierarchical Biases for Structure-aware Long Document Summarization

- https://shuyangcao.github.io/projects/structure_long_summ
- We first construct a document structure tree by leveraging the natural structure
  of sections and subsections
- (1) PathLen(x, y): the length of the shortest path from Sx to Sy;
- (2) LvlDiff(x, y):the level difference from Sx to Sy. PathLen is designed to be asymmetric to capture content ordering
