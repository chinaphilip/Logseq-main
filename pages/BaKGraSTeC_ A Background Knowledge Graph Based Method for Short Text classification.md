title:: BaKGraSTeC: A Background Knowledge Graph Based Method for Short Text classification

- 2020 IEEE International Conference on Knowledge Graph (ICKG)
- This paper proposes a novel Background Knowledge Graph based method for Short Text Classification. Which can not only employ external knowledge from a knowledge graph to enrich text information, but also utilize its structural information through a graph neural network to promote the understanding of texts.
- Specifically, we construct a **background knowledge graph** based on training data, then we propose a novel architecture that integrates background knowledge graph into a graph neural network to model and capture implicit interactions between its concepts and classes
- Besides, we propose an attention mechanism considering both similarity and co-occurrence between concepts and classes to identify the informative concepts in texts
