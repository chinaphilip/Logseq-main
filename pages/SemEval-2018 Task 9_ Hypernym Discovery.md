title:: SemEval-2018 Task 9: Hypernym Discovery

- 该任务是专门为上下位关系识别而设计的共享任务，分为两个子任务，任务一是发现通用语料库中的上位词，并提供了三种不同语言的数据，任务二是识别医疗和音乐领域的上位词
- We define Hypernym Discovery operatively as the task of finding and extracting the appropriate hypernym(s) for a target input term.
- As input for the task, together with the target term, a large textual corpus (source corpus henceforth) is provided, and participating systems are intended to exploit this large source of textual data to retrieve (i.e. “discover”) as many suitable hypernyms as possible for the target term
- The structure of our Hypernym Discovery task consists of five independent but related subtasks, split into two larger groups:
	- general-purpose hypernym discovery
	- and domain-specific hypernym discovery.
-
- We drew taxonomic information from the following lexical resources: WordNet (Miller, 1995), Wikidata. MultiWiBi (Flati et al., 2016), and Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007).
